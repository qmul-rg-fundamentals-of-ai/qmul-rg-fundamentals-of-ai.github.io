**[Carey Bunks](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/careybunks)** will presenting their ongoing work on analysing Transformers

**_Abstract_**

This talk presents a novel analysis of Transformer components based on techniques drawn from model-based stochastic signal processing.  The proposed framework offers a theoretical foundation useful for mechanistic interpretability, and also suggests practical strategies for improving the performance of Transformer architectures.  Some preliminary experimental results will be presented.
